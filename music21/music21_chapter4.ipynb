For instance in a 4/4 measure of two half notes, the first note will be at offset 0.0, and the second at offset 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streams, further, can store other Streams, permitting a wide variety of nested, ordered, and timed structures. These stored streams also have offsets. So if we put two 4/4 Measure objects (subclasses of Stream) into a Part (also a type of Stream), then the first measure will be at offset 0.0 and the second measure will be at offset 4.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical feature of music21’s design that distinguishes it from other music analysis frameworks is that one music21 object can be simultaneously stored (or, more accurately, referenced) in more than one Stream. For examples, we might have numerous Measure Streams contained in a Part Stream. If we extract a region of this Part (using the measures() method), we get a new Stream containing the specified Measures and the contained notes. We have not actually created new notes within these extracted measures; the output Stream simply has references to the same objects. Changes made to Notes in this output Stream will be simultaneously reflected in Notes in the source Part. There is one limitation though: the same object should not appear twice in one hierarchical structure of Streams. For instance, you should not put a note object in both measure 3 and measure 5 of the same piece – it can appear in measure 3 of one piece and measure 5 of another piece."
