Your mileage may vary, but if you require a different set of libraries, you can easily modify the instructions given under **Install Function libraries**. This guide is aimed at MacOs, Ubuntu Linux and Windows users. Windows 10 - as of now - does not fully support the displaying of notation within a given Notebook. Calling the basic music21.show() method will result in the notation being displayed in your notation software of choice. This guide will be modified when a solution is given.\n",
