    "\"Computational thinking is not only something programmers must know, but it is also a thinking tool for understanding our technology-infused social world. It increases our awareness of how our everyday digital tools work, grounds our cyber ethics, and improve sour resilience against various threats such as algorithm-driven attempts to guide our behavior, personally tailored fake news, viral powers of social media, and massive, data-intensive analysis of our movements. What is more, computational thinking has irrevocably changed the tools, methods, and epistemology of science. Learning CT has many benefits beyond programming.\" (*Denning & Tedre 2019, p. xi*)"
